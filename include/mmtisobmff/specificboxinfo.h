 * The general byte structure follows the isobmff standard for a FullBox and is in big endian
 * format.

 * unsigned int(32) size (in bytes)
 * unsigned int(32) fourCC
 * unsigned int(8)  version
 * unsigned int(24) flags
 * unsigned int(8*(size - 12 bytes)) payload
 * .... complete pattern continues until end ....
 * @endcode
 *
 * The format of the payload is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 12.2.7 and mirrors the bitstream syntax
 * version. This can be handy if a decoder is to be fed with this data. In this case it is necessary
 * to just extract the payload sections from above mentioned format and feed them one-by-one to the
 * decoder.
